# Splatoshi Splatoshi

From Bitcoin’s heart, where proof of work was born,
<br>
A crypto launch with a new dawn sworn.
<br>
In memecoins’ wake and hype’s wild ride,
<br>
A fresh frontier, where Bitcoiners stride.
<br>
<br>
Ordinals, Runes, and L2s' sway,
<br>
Sidechains bloom, paving the way.
<br>
Bitcoin’s renaissance shines bright and wide,
<br>
And Splatoshi stands by their side.
<br>
<br>
With fairness forged in work’s true light,
<br>
A closer kin to Bitcoin’s might.
<br>
Miners bound by proof, no ASIC reign,
<br>
GPU stands strong, the rules remain.
<br>
<br>
On this new path, they build with care,
<br>
A native space for Bitcoin’s heirs.
<br>
No need to learn a new domain,
<br>
Splatoshi keeps the interface plain.
<br>
<br>
A launch that's fair, a launch that’s bold,
<br>
For Bitcoin’s future, it takes hold.
<br>
With trust and strength, we're in command,
<br>
Splatoshi rises, across the land.
